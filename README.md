# React Router tutorial

It was a long time that I haven't worked on a react app (without gatsby or nextjs). So I use this [tutorial provided by react router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) as a refresher.

## Setup with React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## createBrowserRouter

This is the newly recommended router for web projects. It uses the DOM History API to update the URL and manage the history stack.

## Project created

This web app will be a _bottin téléphonique_
It will be the pretext to create, read, search, update and delete data.
